# Movie Browser

Welcome to **Movie Browser**, a Progressive Web App (PWA) developed using React JS. This app provides a platform for users to effortlessly search, discover, and explore movies. With an array of features and technologies, this project showcases my proficiency in creating interactive and user-friendly web applications.

## Main Highlights

**Progressive Web App | Lazy Loading and Code Splitting | Debouncing Search | Custom Theme and Dark/Light Mode | Axios Interceptors for Authentication | Thunks and Redux Toolkit | Utils and Helpers | Infinite Scroll**

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/prasadsuraseofficial/GSIV23_Prasad_Surase.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd GSIV23_Prasad_Surase`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:5173/`

## Tech Stack

The application leverages the following technologies and libraries:

- **@emotion/react** and **@emotion/styled**: Employed for efficient CSS-in-JS styling, enhancing component styling maintainability.
- **@fontsource/roboto**: Ensures consistent and visually pleasing typography through the Roboto font.
- **@mui/icons-material** and **@mui/material**: Incorporates Material-UI components and icons to achieve a modern and user-friendly design.
- **@reduxjs/toolkit**: Utilized for state management with Redux, showcasing proficiency in Redux patterns and best practices.
- **axios**: Enables effective handling of HTTP requests and API interactions.
- **lodash.debounce**: Implemented to optimize performance by debouncing user input during search operations.
- **react-infinite-scroll-component**: Enhances user experience with smooth infinite scrolling functionality.
- **react-loader-spinner**: Provides loading spinners for seamless data fetching and transitions.
- **react-redux**: Integrates Redux with React for efficient state management.
- **react-router-dom**: Enables navigation and routing for a seamless user journey.
- **redux-thunk**: Demonstrates handling of asynchronous actions and side effects using Redux middleware.

## Proficiency Showcased

Below are some elements I've done well.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

The app functions as a PWA, offering an almost native app-like experience that can work effectively even when offline.

### Advanced React Patterns

This app incorporates advanced React design patterns, including lazy loading and code splitting techniques. These implementations are aimed at achieving optimal performance and significantly reducing initial load times. Additionally, I've customized the app's design pattern myself to enhance relevance, structure, and professionalism, contributing to an elevated developer experience.

### Search Optimization and UI Enhancements

The search functionality is optimized with debouncing, providing real-time search suggestions and enhancing user interaction.

### Custom Theme and Dark/Light Mode

The custom theme with a dark/light mode toggle demonstrates proficiency in creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

### State Management and Security

The use of Redux Toolkit, thunks, and axios interceptors showcases proficiency in state management, asynchronous actions, and secure API authentication.

### Utility Functions

Creation and integration of utility functions such as `sortMovies` and `minutestoHHMM` highlights attention to detail and data formatting expertise.

### Infinite Scrolling

Incorporating infinite scrolling enhances the browsing experience by dynamically loading more content as users scroll.

## Future Enhancements

With an additional 4 hours or more, I would enhance the application with the following features:

1. **Enhanced Movie Filters**: Introducing advanced filters for genres, ratings, and years to provide a tailored movie browsing experience.

2. **User Profiles**: Implementing user profiles, enabling users to bookmark favorite movies and create a personalized watchlist.

3. **Community Interaction**: Enabling user ratings, reviews, and discussions to foster community engagement.

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improving the mobile responsiveness, focusing on refining the movie details page for a seamless experience.

5. **Advanced Search Algorithms**: Incorporating intelligent algorithms to offer movie suggestions and similar options based on user searches.

## Feedback

The challenge is comprehensive and well-structured. To further enhance it, providing some additional guidelines about below things would be beneficial for candidates.

- 1. Exact api endpoints to be consumed?
- 2. Any specific styling library/framework to be used or plain css/scss?
- 3. Redux toolkit will work or have to use legacy redux?

**Note**: The `.env` file is included to ensure code functionality; kindly replace it with your own credentials/configurations.
